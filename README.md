1Ô∏è‚É£ document Object (Created by JavaScript Engine):

    The JavaScript engine creates the document object when the webpage loads.

    It acts as a bridge between JavaScript and the DOM.

    It provides many APIs (methods like getElementById(), querySelector(), createElement(), etc.) to interact with the DOM.

2Ô∏è‚É£ DOM (Tree Structure of the Webpage):

    The DOM (Document Object Model) is the tree-like structure that represents the entire HTML document.

    The browser parses the HTML and builds the DOM automatically.

    Every HTML element (like <html>, <body>, <p>, etc.) becomes a node in the DOM tree.

    JavaScript can use the document object to read and modify the DOM.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Display Hello World only using script

    <script>
        const division = document.createElement("div")
        const heading = document.createElement("h1");
        heading.innerHTML = "Hello World from javaScript !";
        division.appendChild(heading);
        document.body.appendChild(division);
    </script>

4Ô∏è‚É£ What is CDN?

    A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a network of distributed servers strategically placed across the world. These servers store and deliver web content quickly, efficiently, and securely to users based on their geographic location. CDN serves the content from the nearest server to the user, reducing latency and load times.
        üîπ How Does a CDN Work?
                Step 1: Website Owner Uploads Content
                    When a website owner uploads files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, videos) to a server, they can integrate a CDN to distribute these files across multiple edge servers around the world.
                Step 2: A User Requests a Website
                    When a user visits a website:
                    Their browser requests files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.).
                    The CDN detects the user‚Äôs location.
                    The requested files are served from the nearest CDN server instead of the main origin server.
                    If the file isn't available in the nearest CDN server, it fetches it from the origin server, stores a copy (caches it), and then serves it to the user.
                Step 3: Faster Loading Times
                    Since content is loaded from a closer server, websites load much faster, improving performance and user experience.
        üîπ Common Uses: Hosting JavaScript libraries (React, jQuery, Bootstrap), images, videos, APIs, and fonts.
        üîπ Example: Using React, Bootstrap, or jQuery CDNs instead of downloading files manually.
        CDN Link for ReaCt and ReactDOM:
            FOR DEVELOPMENT
                <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
                <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
            FOR PRODUCTION
                <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
                <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
        üîπcdn link for react is javascript file(.js format) which has code for all the packages/functionalities of react , since react is a js library

5Ô∏è‚É£ Display Hello World using React:

    <script>
        const heading = React.createElement("h1",{},"Hello world from React !");
        const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
        root.render(heading)
    </script>

6Ô∏è‚É£ Difference between React and ReactDOM

    üîπ 1. React (Core Library)

            The core React library that provides the functions required to create UI components.
            Defines React elements, hooks (useState, useEffect), and utilities like React.createElement().
            Does not handle rendering to the DOM (or other environments).

            üî∏ Where is it used?

            Used everywhere React is used, including React Native, React for Web, and Server-side Rendering (SSR).
            Can be used in Node.js, React Native (mobile), and React 3D (Three.js), etc.
            ‚úÖ This creates a React element, but does NOT render it to the webpage.

    üîπ 2. ReactDOM (For Web Rendering)

            Responsible for rendering React components to the actual HTML DOM in a web browser.
            Provides methods like ReactDOM.createRoot() and ReactDOM.render().
            Specifically designed for web applications, unlike React, which can work in different environments.

            üî∏ Where is it used?

            Used only for web development (React Native does NOT use ReactDOM).
            Provides functions that connect React with the browser DOM.

7Ô∏è‚É£ React.createElement ---> doesnot creates a html element, but creates a react elemnt which is an object.  The render function of root accepts a react element (an object)  and renders out the html element.

    üîπ Parameters of React.createElement() ----> React.createElement(type, props, ...children)
            type ----> which can be a string or React Component ----> Ex: The HTML tag ("div", "h1", etc.) or a React component.
            props ----> which is an object ----> Attributes like id, className, onClick, etc. (null if no props).
            ...children ----> those can be React elements, strings, or arrays ----> Ex: The child elements inside the created element.
                            if needed to pass multiple elements as 3rd argument, pass them in array
                            const heading = React.createElement("div",{id:"div1"},[
                            React.createElement("h1",{},"This is h1 tag"),React.createElement("h2",{},"This is h2 tag")]);

8Ô∏è‚É£ What happens in root.render() ?
    In HTML,
    
            <body>
                <h1>Hello</h1>
                <div id = "root">
                    <h2>..................</h2>
                </div>
            </body>
            
    In App.js
        const heading = React.createElement("p",{id:"para"},"This is paragraph")
        const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
        root.render(heading)
    In the above scenario, root.render() will replaces the <h2> tag with the output from root.render(heading). i.e element inside root is replaced and not appended

9Ô∏è‚É£ Library vs framework
    React can even work in small places like within header, or in footer, or within nav, or within menu etc.,  -- work even on small portion of project unlike framework
